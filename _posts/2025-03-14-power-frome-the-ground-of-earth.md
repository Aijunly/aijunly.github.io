力发于地（Power From the Ground of Earth）.
> 我对脚下的土地情有独钟，那是力量、权力和信仰、灵魂的源泉，是我们人类在大千无尽虚空宇宙中唯一可慰藉与信任的坚实依靠，我要为她写一篇长久赞歌，赞颂她默默无闻的无私奉献，和给予每一个人一视同仁的平等！

> I have a fondness for the ground beneath my feet, the source of strength, power and faith, the source of my soul, the only solid dependence on which we human beings can find solace and trust in the vast and endless universe of emptiness, and I will write a long-lasting hymn to her, in praise of her silent selflessness and the equality she gives to every human being without distinction!
