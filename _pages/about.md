I am a worker for mathematica programming in [JUST](www.just.edu.cn) from October 14, 2019. My mainly research interest includes sparse optimization, deep learning and optimal control. 

> Specially, i want to explain the real world which is consist of Universe, Earth (Copper, Stannum, Silver, Gold ...) and Human being (Family, Organization, Country, Government, Economy ...) and its tools (Books, Music, UltraSonic, **COVID-19** ...) in Mathematica. What is pity, I can't always figure it out, tangled up in my brain like a bunch of broken nets.
