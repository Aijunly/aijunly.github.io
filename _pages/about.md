I am a worker for mathematica programming in [JUST](www.just.edu.cn) from October 14, 2019. My mainly research interest includes [mathemmatical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization), [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and [optimal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control). 
> I still want to explain the real world which is consist of the Earth (Copper, Stannum, Silver, Gold ...) and Human being and its tools (Books, Music, Noise, **COVID-19** , **WAR**, **GUN**, **MONEY**, Family, Organization, **COUNTRY**, **GOVERMENT**, **ECONOMY**, **SCIENCE**, **AI**...) by Mathematica. 
 

One more thing 
------
```js
This world is so amazing that my consciousness can't even reach outside the solar system!
```

Two more questions 
------ 
- Shouldn't every person on earth be able to move freely around every corner of the planet? 
- Do I have the right to object categorically to the launching of satellites into the outer space of the Earth by any **individual, Government, Countries or organization**? 
- From the accident of **COVID-19** with the time of Dec. 2019 to Mar. 2023, I am beginning to have deep suspicions about the **GOVERMENT** of all the countries on earth.
- Are we human being the natives of the *Earth*?
