Foundation of Operation Research and Optimization 

======      
From basic to advance with your small steps      



Linear Programming and its Dual Linear Programming
======
Primal Standard Linear programming:      

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\max \quad & z = c^\top x\\
	\rm{s.t.} &~
	\begin{cases} 
		A x =  b  \\
		 ~x \geq  0
	\end{cases} 
\end{aligned}
$$

Its dual linear programming

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \min_{y \in \mathbb{R}^{m} }~& w = b^\top \lambda\\
	    \rm{s.t.} &~ A^{\top} \lambda \geq  c.
    \end{aligned}
$$
