Linear Programming and its Dual Linear Programming
======
Primal Standard Linear programming:      

$$
        A = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        4 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\
        2 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\
        3 & 1 & 4 & 4 \\
        1 & 3 & 1 & 3 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$

Its dual linear programming

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \min_{y \in \mathbb{R}^{m} }~& w = b^\top \lambda\\
	    \rm{s.t.} &~ A^{\top} \lambda \geq  c.
    \end{aligned}
$$
