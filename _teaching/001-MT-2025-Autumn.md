From advance to application with your small steps    

 
Given a matrix 
======

$$
        A = 
        \begin{pmatrix}                 
        4 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\
        2 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\
        3 & 1 & 4 & 4 \\
        1 & 3 & 1 & 3 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
        \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times 4}
$$

and its eigenvalues \\(\lambda_1 = 10,~ \lambda_2 =1, ~ \lambda_3 = 1 + i,~ \lambda_4 = 1 - i\\).
