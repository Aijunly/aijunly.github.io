I have a fondness for the ground beneath my feet, the source of strength, power and faith, the source of my soul, the only solid dependence on which we human beings can find solace and trust in the vast and endless universe of emptiness, and I will write a long-lasting hymn to her, in praise of her silent selflessness and the equality she gives to every human being without distinction!
