## Advice for asking me questions that what i am going to do!?
> 每年总会有学生问我在大学里应该做些啥、学些啥，他（她）总是说很茫然无措，迷茫的像个找不到妈妈的小鹿。我知道，讲大道理、讲人生意义都是假大空般地、八股文似的没有责任可承担的桌上用语，一通输出的结果是我好，你看起来也好了。但是，往往这个结果更加让来和我聊天的学生困惑不安。于是，结合我自己一路求学的经历，以及我认识的、不认识的、相识良久的同学和朋友的一些经历，我给出的建议是：
> 1. 不论你的专业是什么，请学好英语；
> 2. 不论你以后是否还从事和数学相关的工作，那请学好英语和数学，如果你对数学不感兴趣，那请学好其背后的数理逻辑；
> 3. 如果你对未来没有任何规划和思考，那当下请学好数学和英语。
> 4. 如果你不喜欢英语和数学，那请培养由逻辑出发而衍生出来的“独立思考”能力；
> 5. 请学好英语，不需要太高要求，至少能够流利而又顺畅地和他人沟通交流即可；学好数学，也不是考多高的分数，要学其背后的一套逻辑，以及由此构建自己的认知体系！
> 6. 人生的每一步都是在做选择，而选择正确的道路，那需要你有获取真实资料的技能-英语，然后利用逻辑这个强大的工具，去推理演绎选择适合自己的那条道路！

至于如何学好英语和数学，可以自己去网上搜索，自己探索我已经给出的问题的答案，那或许你会有不一样的惊喜和收获！

> Every year, there are always students asking me what they should do and learn in college. They always say they feel lost and disoriented, like a fawn that can't find its mother. I know that talking about grand principles and the meaning of life is empty rhetoric, akin to a bureaucratic speech with no accountability, where the end result is that I feel good, and you look good. However, this often leaves the students who come to chat with me more perplexed and unsettled. So, drawing from my own academic journey, as well as the experiences of classmates and friends I know, knew, or have never met, my advice is:
> 1. Regardless of your major, learn English well.
> 2. Regardless of whether you will work in a math-related field in the future, learn English and math well. If you're not interested in math, then learn the logical reasoning behind it.
> 3. If you have no plans or thoughts for the future, focus on learning math and English for now.
> 4. If you don't like English and math, cultivate the ability to think independently, derived from logic.
> 5. Learn English well, not necessarily to a high standard, but enough to communicate fluently and smoothly with others; learn math not for high test scores, but for the logical framework behind it, and use it to build your own cognitive system!
> 6. Every step in life involves making choices, and choosing the right path requires the skill to obtain accurate information - English, and then using the powerful tool of logic to deduce and choose the path that suits you!

As for how to learn English and math well, you can search online yourself, explore the answers to the questions I've already given, and perhaps you'll have a pleasant surprise and gain!
